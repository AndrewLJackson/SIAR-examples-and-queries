## Questions ecologists often ask

> - What is this aniimal eating?
> - Are these animals specialists or generalists?
> - Why are these populations of animals eating different things?
> - How is this community functioning?

## Isotopes can provide insights

## Moving heavy isotopes is hard work

## Heavy isotopes are chemically sticky

## Observe the states and infer the process
